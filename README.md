Tasks
This repository contains the solutions to the tasks assigned in the ALX software engineering program. The tasks are designed to help students learn various programming concepts and improve their coding skills.

Getting Started
To get started with these tasks, you will need to create a GitHub account, create a personal access token, and clone this repository. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

Create an account on GitHub [if you do not have one already]. You can create a GitHub account for free at https://github.com/join.

Create a Personal Access Token on GitHub. Follow the instructions in the tutorial here to create a token.

Update your profile on the Intranet. Add your Github username here.

Clone this repository using the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
$ git clone https://{YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN}@github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/alx-pre_course.git
Replace {YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN} with your token from step 2.

Replace {YOUR_USERNAME} with your username from step 1 and 2.

Navigate to the directory called 0x01-git in your alx-pre_course repo.

Make sure to include a non-empty README.md in your directory at the root of your repository alx-pre_course and in the directory 0x01-git.

Add, commit and push the changes to the remote server.

bash
Copy code
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git push origin main
Tasks
Repo-session
Create a new directory called 0x01-git in your alx-pre_course repo.

Make sure you include a non empty README.md in your directory:

at the root of your repository alx-pre_course
and in the directory 0x01-git
Coding fury road
Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js.

Create these empty files:

c/c_is_fun.c
js/main.js
js/index.js
Create a file bash/alx with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "ALX".

Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School".

Add all these new files to git, commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”), and push to the remote server.

Collaboration is the base of a company
A branch is like a copy of your project. It’s used mainly for:

adding a feature in development
collaborating on the same code base with other developers
In this task, you will learn how to create and manage branches.

Create a new branch called update_script.

Create a new file called bash/98.

Add some content to this file.

Commit your changes.

Switch to the main branch.

Update your README.md file with the content “My updated README.md file”.

Commit your changes.

Merge the update_script branch into the main branch.

Push your changes to the remote server.

Conclusion
Completing these tasks will help you become a better software engineer. It's important to take the time to understand the concepts behind each task and to ask for help if you need it. Good luck and happy coding!
